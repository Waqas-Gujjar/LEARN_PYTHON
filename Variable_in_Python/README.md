# Variables in Python

In Python, a **variable** is a symbolic name that references a value stored in the computer's memory. Variables are dynamically typed, meaning their type is determined at runtime and can change during execution.

## Characteristics of Variables

1. **Dynamic Typing:** The type of a variable is determined at runtime.
2. **Case Sensitivity:** Variable names are case-sensitive (`Var` and `var` are different).
3. **Naming Rules:** Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_). They can include numbers, but cannot start with them. Keywords cannot be used as variable names.

## Basic Operations with Variables

### 1. Assignment

You assign a value to a variable using the `=` operator.

```python
x = 10
y = "Hello, World!"
z = 3.14
```
